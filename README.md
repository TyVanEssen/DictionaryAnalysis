# DictionaryAnalysis
This project will be a culmination of word analysis techniques. It will use a bst and will (probably) implements tree balancing techniques. It will be able to analyze the dictionary to allow analysis of words and their frequencies. Additonally it will be able to parse text and output statistics like most frequent word, best hangman guesses (most frequent letter). Combined with the dictionary portion will be word analysis such as looking up definitions. 

I am working on this alone.
